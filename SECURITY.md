# Security Policy

None of the authors are security experts. We relied on accepted tools and practices, and tried hard to make this tool solid and well-tested, but nobody's perfect. Please look over the code carefully before using it (and note the legal disclaimer in the [README](./README.md)).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please file an issue in this repo _without including the details_, and we'll be happy to coordinate a secure means of disclosure as well as a timely resolution.
